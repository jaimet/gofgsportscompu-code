    This program uses location services. They are used to track your exercise
    and provide statistical information like distance, average speed and so on.
    This information is kept private and is stored on your local device only (using 'Tracks').
    Uploading one of those 'Tracks' is never done automatically and always has to
    be triggered manually.
